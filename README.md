# Project Overview
Perform data analysis and data preparation tasks to train a Linear Regression model to predict future ROI (Return On Investment) of variable ad spend budgets across multiple channels including search, video, social media, and email using Snowpark for Python, Snowpark ML and Streamlit. By the end of the session, I will have an interactive web application deployed visualizing the ROI of different allocated advertising spend budgets.

### Data Engineering -- Data Analysis and Data Preparation
In this Notebook, I will focus on Data Engineering in Snowflake using Snowpark for Python.

* Establish secure connection to Snowflake
* Load data from Snowflake tables into Snowpark DataFrames
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Snowpark DataFrames
* Pivot and Join data from multiple tables using Snowpark DataFrames
* Demostrate how to automate data preparation using Snowflake Tasks
